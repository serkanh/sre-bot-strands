## FEATURE

We need to build a fastapi based api that will used to serve AWS Strands framwork. It needs to be dockerized and brought up with a docker-compose file for easy local development. Goal is the use same codebase that we can build both and api and a web interface. Api is what will be used to serve the strands framework and exposed to slack bolt framework. 
Keep the web interface minimal and simple. There is an example mentioned in [Strands Web Interface](https://github.com/strands-agents/samples/tree/main/04-UX-demos/05-strands-playground). Make sure to utilize AWS Documentation MCP Server and context7 to search for documentation and examples.
Goal is to builds dead simple way to bring up local development environment for strands framework. Strands should use Bedrock inference for its models.
